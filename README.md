# Geological Properties Ontology
This ontology defines a specialised class of the SOSA Ontology's `ObservableProperty` - a Geological Property. This is an Observable Property that can be found on Geological Features of Interest.

Ontological properties of a Geological Property are described using a combination of the constructes from the SOSA, SWEET and QUDT Ontologies, thus this ontology is a profile of those three ontologies.

## Online
This ontology will soon be visible online at its namespace URI location:

* <http://linked.data.gov.au/def/geoprop>


## Overview
At a high level, the classes of this ontology are shown in Figure 1.

## Data
Data that conforms to this ontology - instances of Geological Properties - will be published by the [Geological Survey of Queensland](http://linked.data.gov.au/org/gsq) in the first half of 2020.


## Repository Contents
This repository contains both the machine-readable ontology file in the RDF Turtle format, [geoprops.ttl](geoprops.ttl), and an HTML web page version of it for people to use [geoprops.html](geoprops.html). The HTML web page is generated semi-automatically from the RDF file and will soon be displayed online at this ontology's namespace location indicated above.
